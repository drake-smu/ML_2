This is a pretty simple assignment.  You will do something you do every day, but today it will be with 
matrix manipulations.

The problem is: you and your work friends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick
a restaurant thats best for everyone.  
Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so everyone is happier.

Despite the simplicity of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.

This process was thougholy investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful
on any number of decision making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

You asked your 10 work friends to answer a survey. They gave you back the following dictionary object.

# Transform the restaurant data into a matrix(M_resturants) use the same column index.

# The most imporant idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.

# 1. Informally describe what a linear combination is  and how it will 
     relate to our resturant matrix.

        A linear combination is an expression of a set of terms that is 
        constructed by multipying the terms by some constant and adding the 
        results to form a singal scalar
        Ex:  Vector [1,2,3,4,5]  ; scalars/coefficients [a,b,c,d,e]
        Linear_Combination = a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4 + e*5


# 2. Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant
     for them.  What does each entry in the resulting vector represent.

# 3. Next compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from 
     all people.  What does the a_ij matrix represent?

# 4. Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get optimal restaurant for all users.
     What do the entryâ€™s represent?

# 5. Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and 
     call it M_usr_x_rest_rank.   Do the same as above to generate the optimal 
     restaurant choice.

# 6. Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What 
     does represent in the real world?

# 7. How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem.

# 8. Find user profiles that are problematic, explain why?

# 9. Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group.

# 10. Should you split in two groups today?

# 11. Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should 
      you adjust. Now what is best restaurant?

# 12. Tommorow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they
      told you their optimal ordering for restaurants.  Can you find their 
      weight matrix?
