## Orientation

The vector cross product, used to define the axis–angle representation, does
confer an orientation ("handedness") to space: in a three-dimensional vector
space, the three vectors in the equation a × b = c will always form a
right-handed set (or a left-handed set, depending on how the cross product is
defined), thus fixing an orientation in the vector space. Alternatively, the
dependence on orientation is expressed in referring to such u→ that specifies a
rotation as to axial vectors. In quaternionic formalism the choice of an
orientation of the space corresponds to order of multiplication: ij = k but ji =
−k. If one reverses the orientation, then the formula above becomes p ↦ q−1 p q,
i.e., a unit q is replaced with the conjugate quaternion – the same behaviour as
of axial vectors.
